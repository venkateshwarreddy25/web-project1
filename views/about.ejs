  I am M. Venkateshwar Reddy, currently pursuing my B.Tech 3rd year. As part of my learning journey, I have developed a dynamic web project using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript). 
  The project is structured using the MVC architecture to maintain a clean and organized codebase. EJS was utilized to build dynamic and reusable front-end views, while Express.js managed server-side logic and routing. 
  I also integrated additional technologies and tools to enhance the applicationâ€™s performance and user experience.
  This project reflects my growing skills in full-stack web development and my ability to build functional, real-world web applications.

  I have developed a dynamic web project using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the templating engine. 
  The application follows the MVC architecture, ensuring a clean and scalable structure. EJS was used to create reusable and dynamic front-end views, while Express handled routing and server-side logic. 
  Additional technologies and tools were integrated to enhance the functionality and user experience, including middleware for request handling, form validation, and database connectivity (if applicable).
   The project demonstrates a full-stack development approach with a focus on performance, maintainability, and user interaction.</p>
